## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is for educational and research purposes only. The use of bypass scripts may violate Roblox's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.

## üìã Features

This framework implements multiple layers of protection against AdonisAC detection:

- **Layer 1: Core Bypass Module** - Embedded bypass that hooks critical AdonisAC functions
- **Layer 2: Smart Delay System** - Waits for anti-cheat initialization before activation
- **Layer 3: Metatable Protection** - Protects game metatables from detection
- **Layer 4: Remote Interception** - Blocks suspicious remote events and kick attempts
- **Layer 5: Behavior Randomization** - Randomizes player behavior to avoid pattern detection
- **Layer 6: Exploit Trace Hiding** - Removes common exploit identifiers
- **Layer 7: Console Hiding** - Optional console output suppression
- **Layer 8: Fake Lag System** - Simulates network latency patterns
- **Layer 9: GetGC Wrapper** - Limits garbage collector access frequency
- **Layer 10: GUI Detection Blocking** - Intercepts and blocks detection GUI elements
- **Layer 12: Connect Protection** - Wraps signal connections for protection

## üé® UI Features

- Modern dark-themed interface
- Real-time progress bar
- Status updates for each loading stage
- Automatic UI dismissal upon completion
- Author information display

## üì¶ Installation

### Direct Download

**Raw Script Link:**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaomao8090/Adonis-Bypass-Framework/master/Adonis%E7%BB%95%E8%BF%871.lua
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the script file (`AdonisÁªïËøá1.lua`)
2. Execute in your Roblox executor
3. Wait for the bypass framework to load
4. The UI will automatically close when loading is complete

## üîß Configuration

The script includes a configurable `CONFIG` table:

```lua
local CONFIG = {
    DELAY = 12,              -- Wait time for anti-cheat initialization
    HIDE_CONSOLE = false,    -- Hide console output
    FAKE_LAG = true,         -- Enable fake lag simulation
    BEHAVIOR_RANDOM = true,  -- Enable behavior randomization
    BLOCK_REMOTES = true,    -- Enable remote interception
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Simply execute the script in your Roblox executor. The script will:

1. Display a loading UI
2. Initialize all bypass layers
3. Show real-time progress
4. Automatically close the UI when complete

## üìù Important Notes

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Script is Obfuscated** - The source code has been obfuscated and optimized for performance and security reasons. This helps prevent detection and improves execution speed.
- The framework must be loaded before AdonisAC fully initializes
- Some layers may take time to activate - be patient during the loading process
- If bypass fails, check your executor's compatibility and support for required functions
- This script is designed for educational purposes - use responsibly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### UI Not Showing
- Ensure your executor supports UI creation
- Check if PlayerGui is accessible

### Bypass Fails
- Try reloading the script
- Ensure you're using a compatible executor
- Check console for error messages

### Script Crashes
- Some executors may not support all features
- Try disabling certain layers in CONFIG
