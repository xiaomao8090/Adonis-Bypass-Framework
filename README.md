## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is for educational and research purposes only. The use of bypass scripts may violate Roblox's Terms of Service. Use at your own risk.

## üìã Features

This framework implements multiple layers of protection against AdonisAC detection:

- **Layer 1: Core Bypass Module** - Embedded bypass that hooks critical AdonisAC functions (currently disabled)
- **Layer 2: Smart Delay System** - Waits for anti-cheat initialization before activation
- **Layer 3: Metatable Protection** - Protects game metatables from detection
- **Layer 4: Enhanced Remote Interception** - Blocks suspicious remote events with pattern matching and multi-layer kick protection
- **Layer 5: Behavior Randomization** - Randomizes player behavior to avoid pattern detection
- **Layer 6: Exploit Trace Hiding** - Removes common exploit identifiers
- **Layer 8: Fake Lag System** - Simulates network latency patterns
- **Layer 9: Safe GetGC Wrapper** - Limits garbage collector access frequency with rate limiting
- **Layer 10: GUI Detection Blocking** - Intercepts and blocks detection GUI elements
- **Layer 11: Call Stack Spoofing** - Masks external script call origins to avoid detection
- **Layer 13: Enhanced Detected Hook** - Hooks AdonisAC's Detected function with improved safety and stability

## üì¶ Installation

### Direct Download

**Raw Script Link (Copy this URL into your executor):**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaomao8090/Adonis-Bypass-Framework/master/AdonisBypass.lua
```

Or use this format in Lua:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiaomao8090/Adonis-Bypass-Framework/master/AdonisBypass.lua"))()
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the script file (`AdonisBypass.lua`)
2. Execute in your Roblox executor
3. Wait for the bypass framework to load
4. Check console for loading progress messages

## üîß Configuration

The script includes a configurable `CONFIG` table:

```lua
local CONFIG = {
    DELAY = 12,              -- Wait time for anti-cheat initialization
    HIDE_CONSOLE = false,    -- Hide console output
    FAKE_LAG = true,         -- Enable fake lag simulation
    BEHAVIOR_RANDOM = true,  -- Enable behavior randomization
    BLOCK_REMOTES = true,    -- Enable remote interception
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Simply execute the script in your Roblox executor. The script will:

1. Wait for game to fully load
2. Initialize all bypass layers sequentially
3. Display progress messages in console
4. Complete bypass setup automatically

## üìù Important Notes

- The framework must be loaded before AdonisAC fully initializes
- Some layers may take time to activate - be patient during the loading process
- Layer 13 (Detected Hook) waits 5 seconds for Adonis to fully load before attempting hook
- Layer 9 (GetGC Wrapper) limits calls to prevent detection
- If bypass fails, check your executor's compatibility and support for required functions
- This script is designed for educational purposes - use responsibly

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Bypass Fails
- Try reloading the script
- Ensure you're using a compatible executor
- Check console for error messages

### Script Crashes
- Some executors may not support all features
- Try disabling certain layers in CONFIG
